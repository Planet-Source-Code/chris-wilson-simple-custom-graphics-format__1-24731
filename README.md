## Simple Custom Graphics Format


</div>

### Description

This is pretty simple code that fakes your own graphics format to protect the bitmaps from being modified. Its really simple code so its pretty self explanitory.
 
### More Info
 
I made the code as reusable as possible so you can use it in your own programs. I am not sure how the speed is on a slower machine, but on my Dual P3 900 its instant :)
